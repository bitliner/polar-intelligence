My reading of academic papers and research notes.

Main topics: **sentiment analysis** and **automatic intelligence**.

## Sentiment Analysis

### Surveys

#### Exploiting New Sentiment-Based Meta-level Features for Effective Sentiment Analysis

- **Topic**: 
  - Sentiment-based meta-level features for sentiment analysis on short text. 
  - Meta-level means: e.g. derived from bag-of-words representation. 
  - Example: sentiment distribution of the k-nearest neighbor of a document; document polarity of neighbors given by unsupervised lexical-based methods
- **Performance**: 
  - Tested on 19 datasets. 
  - **Superior by 16% to bag-of-word representation; largely superior to the best lexicon-based method.**
- **Benefits**: 
  - Transform original feature space into a smaller and more informed one

#### Sentiment Embeddings with Applications to Sentiment Analysis
- **Topic**: 
  - Sentiment Embeddings - Encode text not only with context, but also with sentiment - 
- **Performance**: 
  - Outperforms on multiple datasets the context-based embeddings
- **Benefits**:
  - Inspire same encoding in other specific tasks
  - Apply encoding to improve sentiment

#### üëç Rule-based Information Extraction is Dead! Long Live Rule-based Information Extraction Systems!
- **Topics**:
  - Gap on IE techniques between market and research community, and a roadmap to fill the gap. Gap caused by different perception of usefuless of rule-based systems by the research community

# TODO
- [ ] Find papers from intersection of language acquisition, semi-supervised learning, and sentiment analysis
