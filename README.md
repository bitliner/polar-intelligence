My reading of academic papers and research notes.

Main topics: **sentiment analysis** and **automatic intelligence**.

#### Exploiting New Sentiment-Based Meta-level Features for Effective Sentiment Analysis

- Topic: 
  - sentiment-based meta-level features for sentiment analysis on short text. 
  - Meta-level means: e.g. derived from bag-of-words representation. 
  - Example: sentiment distribution of the k-nearest neighbor of a document; document polarity of neighbors given by unsupervised lexical-based methods
- Performance: 
  - tested on 19 datasets. 
  - **Superior by 16% to bag-of-word representation; largely superior to the best lexicon-based method.**
- Benefits: 
  - transform original feature space into a smaller and more informed one

`Oct 2015`

- Topic: 
  - Sentiment Embeddings - Encode text not only with context, but also with sentiment - 
- Performance: 
  - outperforms on multiple datasets the context-based embeddings
- Benefits:
  - Inspire same encoding in other specific tasks
  - Apply encoding to improve sentiment

# TODO
- [ ] Find papers from intersection of language acquisition, semi-supervised learning, and sentiment analysis
